* To create a plot for assessing roll-ups
    signature("MSnSet", "MSnSet", "character")
    the first object with peptides, second rolled-up to protein level,
    character tells what protein to look at
* Is there a way to document setAs method such that it is under class Rd file?
* Move constructors under methods
* Provide parameter for moderating the outliers. Otherwise they can suppress the
    abundance range.
* Came up with iTRAQ/TMT simulation.  Is there anything fundamentally different
    from other isotope labeling.
